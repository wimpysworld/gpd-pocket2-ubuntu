# GPD Pocket and GPD Pocket 2 hardware configuration for Ubuntu

A couple of scripts for [GPD Pocket](https://gpd.hk/gpdpocket) and [GPD Pocket 
2](https://gpd.hk/gpdpocket2) Ubuntu users.

  * `gpd-pocket-ubuntu.sh`: installs the required hardware configuration on a running Ubuntu install.
  * `gpd-pocket-ubuntu-respin.sh`: respin and existing Ubuntu .iso image add inject the required hardware configuration.

**NOTE!** Both scripts have only been tested on [Ubuntu 
MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org) 18.10. It is unlikely they will work completely 
on Ubuntu if your use Wayland. Almost certainly that only work reliably on one of 
the Ubuntu 18.10 (or newer) flavours.

## Pre-configured image

The Ubuntu MATE team offers a bespoke image for the GPD Pocket and GPD Pocket 
2 that includes the hardware specific tweaks to get these devices working 
*"out of the box"* without any faffing about.

  * <https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/>

### gpd-pocket-ubuntu.sh

Install one of the Ubuntu 18.10 (or newer) flavours on a GPD Pocket or GPD
Pocket 2 and run the following to inject the required hardware configuration.

```
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/gpd-pocket2-ubuntu.git
cd gpd-pocket2-ubuntu
sudo ./gpd-pocket-ubuntu.sh enable || disable
```

You must supply one of the following modes of operation

  * `enable`  : apply the GPD Pocket hardware configuration
  * `disable` : remove the GPD Pocket hardware configuration
  * `help`    : This help.

### gpd-pocket-ubuntu-respin.sh

```
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/gpd-pocket2-ubuntu.git
cd gpd-pocket2-ubuntu
```

  * Download an .iso image for one of the Ubuntu 18.10 (or newer) flavours.
  * Edit `gpd-pocket-ubuntu-respin.sh` and update the `ISO_IN=` with the full path the .iso your downloaded.

```
sudo ./gpd-pocket-ubuntu-respin.sh
```

A new .iso will be created that includes the additional hardware tweaks
required by the GPD Pocket and GPD Pocket 2.
